# Otrio Android Studio App

## Description
Otrio is an Android app that features both a two-player mode and a single-player mode. Players aim to win by achieving one of the following conditions:
- Getting three pieces of the same color (small, medium, and large) in the same spot.
- Forming a line or diagonal with three pieces of the same size.
- Creating a line or diagonal with one of each size (small, medium, and large) in order.

## Requirements
- Android Studio (version 4.1 or higher)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) (version 1.8 or higher)
- Android SDK (with API Level 21 or higher)

**Note:** This app works best on older and smaller screens, as it was designed with those dimensions in mind. For the best experience, use smaller emulators. Running this on newer Samsung phones might not match the dimensions and could cause the app to look unappealing.
